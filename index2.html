            <p class="aboutme">Hello! My name is Jeremy, and as you can see from the picture above, I clearly am a child a heart. 
                I grew up loving video games, comic books, anime, sports and birds! I grew up military family, which
                brought me to many places as a kid.
            </p>

            <p class="aboutme">
                In my adult life, I am now pursuing a career in Software Development. Hopefully later on down the road
                I can build my skills as an engineer to possibly get into game Development. Currently I am studying at
                UCLA Extension, Full-Stack Web Developer Boot-Camp!
            </p>
