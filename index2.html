        <p class="aboutme">Hello! My name is Jeremy, and as you can see from the picture above, I clearly am a child a
            heart.
            I grew up loving video games, comic books, anime, sports and birds! I grew up military family, which
            brought me to many places as a kid.
        </p>
        
        <p class="aboutme">
            In my adult life, I am now pursuing a career in Software Development. Hopefully later on down the road
            I can build my skills as an engineer to possibly get into game Development. Currently I am studying at
            UCLA Extension, Full-Stack Web Developer Boot-Camp!
